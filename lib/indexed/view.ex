  A data structure about a view, held in ETS.

  While prefilters may be defined statically when warming an index, views
  also define prefilters, but they are tailor-made result sets which can be
  created and destroyed throughout the `t:Indexed.t/0` lifecycle.

  Views define a prefilter to base its result set on. (`nil` is acceptable
  for full result set.) Then, a `:filter` function is used to further narrow
  the results.

  * `:filter` - A function which takes a record and returns a truthy value if
    it should be included in the result set. Required.
  * `:maintain_unique` - List of field name atoms for which a list of unique
    values under the view will be managed. These lists can be fetched via
    `Indexed.get_uniques_list/4` and `Indexed.get_uniques_map/4`.
  * `:params` - Original user params for building `:filter` and `:prefilter`.
    These are kept mainly for authorization checking in the depending
    application.
  * `:prefilter` - The base prefilter from which the `:filter` further refines.
